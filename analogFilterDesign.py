#TODO: Geffe Algorithm + Run Geffe Algorithm

#TODO: Acquire peak frequency

#TODO: Should be able to take inputs and give advice for boundaries for Km, Kf and return the roots of the characteristic equation

#TODO: Tow-Thomas Universal Filter + Run Plot of Output + Allow for selection of low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, notch or all-pass.

#TODO: Have calculation of the butterworth poles and Qo's associated with that and a pretty printing of the values available for what order. For whatever n is, print all values below and two values above. 

#TODO: Specifying K0, Kp, Ks, wp, ws -> produce low-pass or high-pass design, naming n, w0 and 

#TODO: Generate valid variable 's' for plotting a response.

#TODO: Highpass transformation into the lowpass

#TODO: Lowpass prototype calculations
